# historicalStorms

This collection of Python codes downloads historical wave and water level time series and outputs a colleection of historical storms defined as periods of time where the significant wave height is above the 90th percentile (for the entire historical record) for longer than 12 hours in durations. Periods of continous threshold exceedance that were within 24 hours of each other were taken as the same storm.

This code is semi-automated, and requires some manipulation in Excel.
